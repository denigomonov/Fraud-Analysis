# Fraud-Analysis

## Project Goal:
My main goal in this project was to see how well Keras can be used to classify binary. First, I wanted to perform a visual analysis to discover if there are any trends that can be spotted from a human perspective and point out features of interest. Finally, after labeling and feeding the data to the model, I assessed the performance of this approach.
